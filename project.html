			<h3>Describe</h3>
			<p>Novelis recently engaged Zugara to develop an Augmented Reality mobile app that could help act as an interactive sales tool for Novelis’ product team. The AR experience needed to help communicate the product features and attributes for Novelis’ new aluminum battery enclosure for electric vehicles. AR was utilized within the mobile app to enhance product demonstrations on multiple fronts:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>An augmented reality product demonstration showed the battery enclosure in both an enclosed and expanded view. Different sub part features could be selected and viewed in a real world environment (pictured above).</li>
			  <li>The AR presentation of the product could be scaled for a full-size product demonstration in a factory or reduced for display on a conference room table during a board room presentation.</li>
			  <li>Different product features (including chemical compositions) were selectable and viewable in AR mode. In addition, we developed 3D viewable data that could assist engineers with viewing data in AR while also viewing specific product sub part information.</li>
			</ul>
